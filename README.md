# Maison - Decentralized Vercel / Immutable Frontends

Initially started during the ETHCC 2022 Paris Hackathon. [First Demo here](https://devpost.com/software/maison-f10xmy).

## Overview
Want to create a tooling without allows for deployment for static sites through a decentralized stack. I admire companies such as Liquity who have fully decentralized their front-end. This is a potential direction that protocols can take.

<br/> Make Decentralized Front ends cool.<br/>

## Stack
- Storage: IPFS & Arweave
- Domains: ENS
- Data: TBD


## ToDo List üèó

- [x] Intital V1
- [x] New designs for v2
- [ ] End to End IPFS Deployment
- [ ] Figure out the deploy / VM Container
- [x] End to End ArWeave Deployment
- [ ] Continous Deployment
- [ ] Integerate a web3/decentralized DB stack.
