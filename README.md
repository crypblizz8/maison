# Maison - Decentralized Vercel / Immutable Frontends

Initially started during the ETHCC 2022 Paris Hackathon. <br/> [First Demo here](https://devpost.com/software/maison-f10xmy).

## Overview
Want to create a tooling without allows for deployment for static sites through a decentralized stack. I admire companies such as [Liquity](https://www.liquity.org/frontend) who have fully decentralized their front-end. This is a potential direction that protocols can take.

<br/> Make Decentralized Front ends cool.<br/>

## Stack
- Storage: IPFS & Arweave
- Domains: ENS
- Data: TBD


## ToDo List üèó
P1:
- [ ] Start working on the ARWeave Integration
- [ ] Rework IPFS for static page deployment

P2:
- [ ] Change Radicle --> Other
- [ ] Add all the Frontend resources

P3:
- [ ] Fix Min Height

MVP Release:
- [ ] Test with 5 - 10 people
- [ ] Tweet out the prototype

Nice to have/ future:
- [ ] Integerate a web3/decentralized DB stack.
- [ ] Continous Deployment

Finished:
- [x] Intital V1
- [x] New designs for v2
- [x] Figure out deployment
- [x] Figure out Layout
- [x] RainbowKit Button
